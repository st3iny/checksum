# Checksum

Sidebar plugin for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) to create hashes of files.

## Installation

Download the archive of the most recent tag or clone this repository into your apps folder and checkout the desired tag.


## Usage

Open the details view of the file (sidebar). There should be a new tab called "Checksum".
Select an algorithm and it will try to generate a hash.

Possible algorithms are md5, sha1, sha256, sha384, sha512 and crc32.


## Compatibility

I only tested the app on Nextcloud v20 to v21 and php v7.4.
